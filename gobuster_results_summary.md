|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| /login            | 200         | Login page found                                   |
| /register         | 200         | Registration page found                            |
| /profile          | 302         | Redirects to /login (authentication required)      |
| /uploads          | 301         | Redirects to /uploads/ (possible file upload dir)  |
| /storage          | 301         | Redirects to /storage/ (potentially sensitive)     |
| /password         | 405         | Method not allowed (possible password endpoint)    |
| /test             | 500         | Server error (potential vulnerability)             |
| /up               | 200         | Page accessible, purpose unknown                   |
| /logout           | 405         | Method not allowed (logout endpoint exists)        |
| /build            | 301         | Redirects to /build/ (possible dev directory)      |
| /dashboard        | 302         | Redirects to /login (authentication required)      |
| /forgot-password  | 200         | Password reset functionality                       |
| /server-status    | 403         | Forbidden (Apache server-status enabled)           |

### **Key Findings & Next Steps**

- **Login/Registration:** `/login` and `/register` are accessible; test for authentication, enumeration, and poor credential handling.
- **Profile/Dashboard:** 302 redirects hint at protected user areas—potential for privilege escalation or IDOR testing.
- **Uploads/Storage:** 301 redirects may indicate file storage—check for improper access or upload vulnerabilities.
- **Forgot Password:** Test for password reset flaws.
- **Test (500 error):** The `/test` endpoint returning a server error is a potential vulnerability—investigate for information disclosure or logic flaws.
- **Server-status (403):** `/server-status` is present and forbidden, indicating Apache server-status is enabled, which could leak info if misconfigured.
- **Other (405, 200):** Investigate `/up`, `/password`, `/logout` for unintended exposure or misconfiguration.

**Recommendation:**  
Continue testing these endpoints with:
- Manual exploration and parameter fuzzing
- Vulnerability scans (e.g., Nikto, OWASP ZAP)
- Authentication and session management testing
- File upload/download checks
